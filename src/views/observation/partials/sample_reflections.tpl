		<p>Vision for Deepthought- Mr. Yugandhar started by giving the example of a classroom of professors held at IIM Kolkata. He wishes the same experiences to happen for everyone at Deepthought. &nbsp;It was a classroom where threads were woven together to form patterns that were meaningful, productive, and engaging to meet a common objective. The teacher and the learners both are part of the threads. Teachers are facilitators. The learners are given experiences in the process and they are part of building the product.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>You need to be open-minded, humble, and have the ability to learn with child-out like curiosity. Your individual contribution is important. Your contribution is helping the coming people in experiencing the product. We are following a framework because we have a common objective. But we are not rigid about it. The environment is dynamic. Everyone is encouraged to be innovative all the time. In Deepthought, we don&rsquo;t teach techniques, we get you through the process of developing the techniques. We want to change the face of India from an assembling country to a designing country.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Deepthought is a deep technology organization enabling the teaching and learning mechanisms of the future. Deepthought is different from the industry because we are enabling the teachers, students, and everyone in exploring the idea by researching and learning. We are building an unadulterated and pristine environment for the teachers and the students to learn in a classroom. We want to reposition the education industry how Tesla repositioned the automobile industry. For the world, Deepthought is a beautiful phenomenon because you will have more holistic individuals taking care of the institutions. It is our contribution toward making the world a better place.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>DeepThought is a technology company that aims to revolutionize the way we perceive education. To put in the words of Mr. Yugandhar Reddy COO of DeepThought, at a deeper level the organization wishes to &ldquo;reawaken the instinct of humanity of learning and questioning to live for the planet&rdquo; which has been inhibited by the compartmentalized thinking brought by specialization.</p>
		<p>Targets of DeepThought also include making the youth compassionate and empathetic towards the world by providing them with holistic education. The organization plans to do that through research-based education by providing them a nurturing environment.</p>
		<p>To execute the plan DeepThought has formulated an ever-evolving framework like a hand-woven cloth using threads of different colors. Every individual, be it a student, teacher, or intern at DeepThought can introduce a color of their choice and weave it according to their imagination. The framework has both rigidity, to keep the organization directed on the path they have chosen and flexibility, to allow creativity to take place. The framework is flexible to the level that the path chosen can also be altered if needed.</p>
		<p>As we grow older the conditioning &ndash; set perspectives imposed upon us by our upbringing, our surroundings, and society in general- tends to kill the curiosity. So, while working on the framework, interns need to be aware of their own conditioning, or to put it broadly they need to have self-knowledge. That will help them in realizing their own limitations and how not to let them hinder the learning process.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The framework then enables the interaction of students and teachers. It will be such a classroom where teachers won&rsquo;t explain theorems to students but facilitate a process for children to arrive at their own theorems and theories. These will democratize the education in true sense. And it will prepare the students for the world to come while living in harmony with the planet and cosmos.</p>

			<br />In the video, Mr . Yugandhar Reddy started with his IIM Calcutta experience wherein A classroom two-sided Arguments were happening which he called "jugal bandi" they enjoyed the class but in end, they were not able to articulate what happened. but DT a lot of threads are worn in which there is productive, engaging to meet a common objective to make a cloth where everyone is involved like a teacher, learner, and environment for that we need eagle view for learning. it can be possible only if we have intention and background because we need to have child-like curiosity which is not found in adults. Children will always ask why and how if we have that we will be able to build the thread as it adds up at the end. Where no matter how small your movement is Just like a butterfly effect that has potential. children should be put in creative and critical situations to create a learning environment that we can create with the help of interns. further, they started with a question and answer where Aaryan asked to elaborate more on the butterfly effect to which Mr.Reddy answered that if butterfly flaps wings in the Amazon desert then a storm might take place in some part of the world. where he further took the example of Aaryan and how did he come to the session. Where the answer to this was because he saw the message and he saw it because he is connected with DT. Also, he made him understand the pattern in which everything happens. The next question was if the following framework kills curiosity so at what point should we break the framework. The answer to this was if we are in dessert we should have a directional notion where we need to be less rigid so it won't stop to explore dessert. Another question Sai was when he told about being open-minded and background what did he meant by background to which he answered if he is working with experience directly with interns then he can influence them which might lead to discouragement because of a belief system which brings baggage example the test paper has success if we pass. But in DT it's a little different. When asked if his baggage is good or bad where he answered realization is important. Another question asked by Komal was about mechanism thinking. To which he acknowledged as answers and given to what is asked where we are not involved sometimes. Where he gave the example of Buddha. Where everyone has that eureka movement. Where Komal asked DT is bringing an environment to create eureka movement. Where he answered he don't know how but he knows the path. Where thread builder was is called something previously where people can engage with thread by conversation and articulate that. He shares the example of a junior MBA and why do the burgers mold in it. Where DT don't give such an example instead they teach the process as well with technique. Where he added India wants innovation. Whereas today parts are only assembled but designed somewhere else. So the process is to encourage. Where our thread is built impacts outsiders but processes inside. The next question was are there systemic problems to which Mr.reddy answered that it is structural problems. Where everything is coding in a particular manner without our experience is a systemic problem. Where a question related to it was asked as to why we call it a structural problem. Where he said even if we do think intentionally, or unintentionally, liking or disliking we are articulate thinks. Where Tarun also asked if DT say they are not an educational company but a technological product innovation company what would be Mr reddy thoughts. Where he said he never thought DT to be an educational company whereas they are into deep technology companies like visa cards where transactions happen. When Tarun further asked why DT thought it was a visa platform he said because there is teaching for the process also the structure. Where Harvard and MIT are also limited. Where they teach the definition of business as profit which us not core belive. One other question was whether experience may lead to innovation are we building the thread to the future so will we kill the experience ahead. To which he acknowledged with an example of sun moon nanotechnology. A term which we don't know concocted where we start to think if we don't know then we have the curiosity to know or give it up. And Tarun asked to describe DT to which Mr. Reddy said DT is enabling the teach the future. Tarun further asks how is DT different from others. To which he said the teach deep not at 1-degree or 2-degree surface. Where we give research-based learning. Further, they went ahead with reflections. <br />

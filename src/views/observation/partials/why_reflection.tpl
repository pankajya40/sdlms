						<p>Are you listening keenly or are you preoccupied with your own opinion? Do you find the content repetitive and that you already know it? Or are you mature enough to see the subtle aspects that need keen listening.</p>
						<p>
							In fact, many applicants find it very difficult to take feedback here- ego takes over learning. They start getting defensive. Ex: Chintu says that he didn't want to repeat what the speaker said and that he wrote
							his own version. Chintu was told that both repetition and tangential reflection are not desired and that one needs to build on the threads. Chintu agreed but couldn't handle this emotionally.

						<p>
							A person who is true at heart is a good listener and distances self away from the content. This enables seamless learning and unbiased problem-solving. This emotional composure is extremely important because one
							can really get hurt in a collaborative environment if ego runs high. In fact, this article hurts people with a high ego. If you feel so, maybe it is time to reflect and work on the ego.

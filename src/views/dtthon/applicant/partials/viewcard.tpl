                A social scorecard is a tool used to assess a user's behavior or learnings during a certain activity. It is a form of subjective evaluation in which a scorer is requested to assign a candidate a score based on a set of
                parameters and sub-parameters. A "scorecard" that has been given a score is being treated as a person's asset and will be shown where it belongs. Based on the learning you accomplished during this process, you received your
                scores. Excited to see your scores.

                Why are you here? Are you a learner here? Do you want a more intuitive learning process? Is what you did meaningful? OR It matters how you feel, right? Let's do a quick evaluation on the reflections you provided. We have a
                methodology here that we term a "Scorecard," and you can score yourself using it. To gain more perspective for the learning you did during this procedure, simply score yourself.
